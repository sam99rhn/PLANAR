# Planar Triangulated Graph Visualizer

A web-based tool for drawing and manipulating planar triangulated graphs with dynamic vertex addition.

## Features

- Draw planar triangulated graphs
- Dynamically add vertices to the periphery
- Zoom and pan functionality
- Toggle between color and index display
- Support for up to 10,000 vertices

## How to Use

1. Click "S: Start Graph" to initialize with a basic triangle
2. Use "A: Add Vertex" to manually add vertices by selecting two peripheral vertices
3. Use "R: Add Random Vertex" to add a vertex at a random position
4. Use the zoom buttons or mouse wheel to zoom in/out
5. Click and drag to pan the view
6. Use "C: Center Graph" to reset the view
